                    <h2>evolution</h2>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
                        do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have
                        had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                        time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including
                        our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                    <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and
                        exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in
                        our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to
                        bring your students through for a visit.</p>
