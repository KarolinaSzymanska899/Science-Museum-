                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
                        do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have
                        had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                        time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including
                        our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                    <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of
                        the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
                        here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                        becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                        the whole planet.</p>
                    <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global
                        warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                        contribute to a brighter future.</p>
