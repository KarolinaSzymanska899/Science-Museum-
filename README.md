# Science-Museum

The Science Museum website was made as a Semester Project 1 in my 1st year at Noroff Frontend Development.
The Project is one of my very first ones and I used HTML and CSS here. It is a responsive, informative website for a fictional Science Museum. The six included pages are: 1. Index, 2. Explore, 3. Exhibitions, 4. Events, 5. Visit, 6. Get involved.

# Project focus
The main focus was on HTML and CSS skills, project planning, visual design, conformity to WCAG guidelines, target audience analysis, SEO.
